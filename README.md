# Somali_Accent_DB

## Overview
Somali_Accent_DB is a linguistic dataset designed to capture variations in Somali speakers' pronunciation of English words. 
This dataset aims to support research in speech recognition, linguistic studies, and AI applications focused on Somali-accented English.

## Features
- **Speech Collection**: Audio recordings from Somali speakers covering various regions and dialects.
- **Metadata Annotations**: Each recording is labeled with speaker details such as age, gender, and regional background.
- **Word Segmentation**: Audio files are processed into individual words for phonetic and linguistic analysis.
- **Accent Analysis (Future Work)**: Planned integration of AI models for accent classification and speech recognition.
- **Public Dataset (Future Goal)**: A structured, open-access database for researchers and developers working on Somali speech processing.

## Project Goals
- To facilitate accent-aware speech recognition models.
- To support linguistic studies on Somali-accented English.
- To create an open-source dataset for research and educational purposes.
